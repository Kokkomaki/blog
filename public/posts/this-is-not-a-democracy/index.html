<ul>
<li>Open communication and strong team spirit are essential for a functional work environment.</li>
<li>Leaders should have a vision and make decisions, but not just bark orders.</li>
<li>Trust is fundamental in any relationship, including professional ones.</li>
<li>Emotions should not be seen as weaknesses; they are integral to human interaction and decision-making.</li>
<li>Emotional intelligence is crucial for effective leadership.</li>
<li>Creating a positive work culture where people feel valued and respected is more important than rigid efficiency.</li>
<li>Leaders should empathize with employees and understand their needs and motivations.</li>
<li>Changing workplace culture to prioritize human well-being can coexist with achieving business goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things had slowly gotten terrible at work, and I knew it was coming. The space had become increasingly bitter and unfixable, like dealing with an indifferent and absent father.</p>
<p>The whole problem might probably have stemmed from how the industry operates. It&rsquo;s all about rigid rules and following orders from the top.</p>
<p>Sure, rules are good for keeping things organised, I agree. But without open communication and a strong team spirit, you can&rsquo;t really work together. A leader needs to have a vision and make calls, but barking orders creates a cold, unfriendly environment.</p>
<p>Think about a family. A parent makes decisions for the kid until she grows up, but there&rsquo;s still talking, listening, and understanding - without yelling or fighting; without abstracting it all into &ldquo;päiväkoti&rdquo; (kindergarten).</p>
<p>Trust is key to everything. Even the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, understood that. Without trust, problems just drive wedges between people, turning coworkers into strangers. It is hardly about what is being said and done, but about the underlying need and the emotion that drives that need. A good leader and a parent hears them.</p>
<p>The corporate world often feels cold and controlled, with strict rules that stamp out emotions. It&rsquo;s like feelings are weaknesses. I remember a friend who cried at work - she got fired. Now it was my turn.</p>
<p><img src="/images/this-is-not-a-democracy-clideo_editor_8911031285244606a99b84ba96463acf.gif" alt=""><em>Getting fired over text be like.</em></p>
<p>This lack of trust and stifling of emotions and needs creates a place where ruthlessness is rewarded. We&rsquo;re treated like objects, just moved around because the boss pays the bills.</p>
<p><img src="/images/this-is-not-a-democracy-tumblr_mappw0atoa1qcic7yo2_r1_500-1.gif" alt=""><em>When employer thinks only money motivates.</em></p>
<p>Why separate emotions from logic? Science says they&rsquo;re linked. We&rsquo;re human, after all. Only leaders who get this can be truly great. It&rsquo;s about emotional intelligence, not just giving (senseless) orders. It&rsquo;s about leaders who understand that their role is to give <em>directions with a clear goal in mind</em>, to listen, to empathise, and to lead by example.</p>
<p>It seems like emotional intelligence is the last thing on anyone&rsquo;s mind. It&rsquo;s all about efficiency and profit, with no regard for the well-being of the people who make it all happen. And that&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the solution? How do we create a better work environment? It&rsquo;s not about changing the rules or the structure. It&rsquo;s about changing the culture. It&rsquo;s about creating a culture where people feel valued, heard, and respected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about recognising that people are not just machines, but human beings with feelings, needs, and desires. It&rsquo;s about creating a workplace that is not just efficient, but also fulfilling and meaningful.</p>
<p>I understand that there are other result-driven agendas that are more important for the leader than intangible workplace culture, such as financial pressure and stakeholder demands.</p>
<p>However, external factors do not necessarily negate the importance of cultivating a positive and supportive work environment. In other words, leaders do not have to choose between addressing financial pressures and improving workplace culture – these goals can coexist and be pursued simultaneously. Suffice to say, it is not easy to be a leader. I empathise with that.</p>
<p>People are motivated by different things. For me, money isn&rsquo;t everything. I value work that matters, that makes a real difference in people’s lived lives. I believe that crypto open, neutral, permissionless, decentralised, and public blockchains can improve people&rsquo;s lives compared to the traditional financial systems.</p>
<p>But you can&rsquo;t really get to know someone or build trust if never spend time having long conversations, grabbing lunch, or sharing a beer after work. It won&rsquo;t happen if you don&rsquo;t make the effort.</p>
