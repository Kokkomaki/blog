<p>Pöö pöö dear friends and friends&rsquo; friends,</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know where to start honestly. There&rsquo;s a lot to say about me and as much not to say. I keep juicy secrets, like you, that&rsquo;s for sure. I&rsquo;m not going to tell every little detail about me to internet strangers. I have to play it cool, if you know what I mean? So all I could tell is a curated narrative, skewed by my willingness to share certain aspects, conditioned by time and context.</p>
<p><em>Boring!</em> as my fiancee would say. So, surely I have to tell you something. We could ask who I am based on what I do and don&rsquo;t do. I write blog sometimes, research about Bitcoin, vibecode when needed, play guitar but not so much these days, do sauna whenever possible, meditate vipassana every day for an hour at least, hang out with friends, cook plant-based foods, exercise in the gym, drink litres of tea, and sleep shamingly long. I don&rsquo;t drink coffee, follow crypto prices, use social media, play video games anymore,&hellip; And now I don&rsquo;t know what to tell.</p>
<p>But even now we don&rsquo;t pierce through those apparent layers to find out about the true me. (Do, I, <em>even</em> know the true &ldquo;me&rdquo;?) After all, it is not so much about what we do and did during our lifetime that describe us best. Rather it is the little things that happen in the here and now. It is in how I make you feel. And this is only something that you can find out by hanging out with me, really. But as far as this blog goes, it&rsquo;s basically a public journal of opinions and experiences than a curriculum vitae, a portfolio, or a place of a niche topic.</p>
<p>A brief note on the use of large language models like ChatGPT or Claude (heretofore, &ldquo;AI&rdquo;). I do use AI mostly for structuring draft notes, get feedback, generate lists and tables, spar ideas, and vibe code. I have used AI sparingly to generate text on occassion, and copy pasted it with edits. However, I make sure that on the whole the text doesn&rsquo;t lose &ldquo;soul&rdquo; and retains my writing style. In general, I abhor AI-generated text, and I can see it a mile away. AI kills the purpose of writing: For me writing is a way to think, create, share, and most of all, write.</p>
<p><strong>How to contact me?</strong></p>
<p>You can send me email to kokkomaki (at) tuta (dot) io</p>
