# What am I doing now?

I am writing from Turku right now. I have been an active job seeker since June 2024. Previously I worked as a business manager in a crypto-asset wallet provider (basically a "crypto bank") in Turku. Since then I have been looking for work, but alas it has bore no fruit insofar. I have spent my time meditating and cultivating my skills in other fronts. I updated blog 

In October 2024, I found myself in a 10-day Vipassana-meditation retreat; now five times. It changed my worldview and my mind. I am currently looking forward to the next retreat. I am tinkering with blog, and trying to network with people. I am thinking of other things to do, for example a doctoral research on Bitcoin, and learning coding.

I am meditating and praying daily. After the last meditation retreat on August, I proposed to a lovely woman and we are now engaged.
