  <p><img src="/images/on-being-powerless-about-the-genocide-in-gaza-ev1mogmr.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the quiet of my room, far from the tumultuous events unfolding in Gaza, I find myself reflecting on the feeling of powerlessness.</p>
<p>My two friends, who I met in a peace program, often share stories and updates about Gaza on social media. Initially, I was glued to these updates. And not just to what my two friends were posting; I was scrolling through a bunch of different posts from all sorts of people talking about Gaza.</p>
<p>Each morning, I&rsquo;d wake up to the latest reels and news, watching as the death toll climbed—it was “only” 7000 then. But with each passing day, my life, already filled with spiky anxiety, became increasingly suffused with sorrow and dread. I couldn&rsquo;t escape the heartbreaking images of what was happening over there. It was just too much. So, to give my mind a break, I switched to watching funny cat and dog videos, scrolling through Star Wars memes, and relationship therapy content.</p>
<p>This led me to my first realisation: <strong>the importance of self-education and spreading awareness within our social circles, which is the first step towards fostering understanding and empathy.</strong> Many of my friends were oblivious to the crisis, not having the exposure to such content in their feeds.</p>
<p>Here in Turku, as in many other places around the world, one can feel insignificant in the face of such a massive crisis. You might wonder,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What can I do to make a difference?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>One effective way to contribute is by participating in public protests and demonstrations.</strong></p>
<p>I remember stumbling upon a street booth selling cinnamon buns for a small donation. This encounter led me to learn about a local protest. Although I missed that particular event, I made it a point to join a subsequent one. It was my first protest, and I approached it with an open, unbiased mind, as befits a peace student.</p>
<p>The experience was transformative. The act of protesting, of being part of a collective voice, instilled a sense of empowerment amidst feelings of helplessness. The unity and shared emotions were palpable, and even the scorn of a passerby who dismissed our efforts couldn&rsquo;t diminish the solidarity we felt.</p>
<p><strong>Another impactful action is to boycott products that have ties with Israel</strong>, such as Coca Cola, McDonald&rsquo;s, and Starbucks.</p>
<p>Why? Consider the case of South Africa&rsquo;s Apartheid; boycotts played a significant role in its downfall. While the effectiveness of such actions might be debated, they certainly empower us to make a stand. It’s about making choices that align with your values. Moreover, we live in a capitalist society where alternatives are plentiful. It doesn’t hurt to switch products.</p>
<p>The journey of fighting against injustices, like the one in Gaza, is filled with moments of helplessness. But by educating ourselves, spreading awareness, participating in protests, and making conscious consumer choices, we can each play a part. It&rsquo;s about harnessing our collective power to make a difference, no matter how small it may seem.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t paint this blog post&rsquo;s ending with a rosy picture. The road to change is long and often thankless. We might not see the results of our efforts today, or even tomorrow. But, it&rsquo;s about doing something, anything, instead of just watching. Whether it&rsquo;s educating others, hitting the streets, or choosing where to spend our money, each action chips away at the larger problem. So, here&rsquo;s to doing what we can, in our own small ways, to demand and drive change. Sometimes, that&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;ve got, and often, it&rsquo;s enough.</p>
